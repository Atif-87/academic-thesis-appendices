Testing Scripts Repository

The repository holds the reference scripts, which were utilized in the process of testing UE (User Equipment) and gNB ( Next Generation Node B) simulations. The scripts help in configuration, automation and network operations, including:

1. UE Configuration Template

2. Automatic File Generation (SKELL)

3. gNodeB Instance Management

4. UE Registration/Authentication, PDU Setup and De-Registration

These scripts assist in automating the UE actions along with conducting network operations within controlled test networks.



Generate UE configuration files

./gen-file.sh
# Example:
# Enter starting IMSI [default: 1000000001]: 1000000001
# Enter number of UEs to generate [default: 10]: 5



Start gNB instances

./gnb.sh 5
# Starts 5 gNB instances from port 1200 to 1204


Simulate UE operations


./all.sh
# Choose one of:
# reg   → Registration
# pdu   → PDU Session Establishment
# unreg → De-registration
