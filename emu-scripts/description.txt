Testing Scripts Repository

The repository holds the reference scripts, which were utilized in the process of testing UE (User Equipment) and gNB ( Next Generation Node B) simulations. The scripts help in configuration, automation and network operations, including:

1. UE Configuration Template

2. Automatic File Generation (SKELL)

3. gNodeB Instance Management

4. UE Registration/Authentication, PDU Setup and De-Registration

These scripts assist in automating the UE actions along with conducting network operations within controlled test networks.
